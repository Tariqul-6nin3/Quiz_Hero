              <li>
                <strong>Map:</strong> This method creates a new array with the
                results of calling a function on every element in the array. It
                returns a new array with the same length as the original array.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Filter:</strong> This method creates a new array with
                all the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided
                function. It returns a new array with only the elements that
                meet the specified condition.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>ForEach:</strong> This method calls a function for each
                element in the array. It does not return anything, it simply
                iterates over the array and performs the specified action on
                each element.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Find:</strong> This method returns the value of the
                first element in the array that satisfies the provided function.
                It returns undefined if no element satisfies the condition.

            <div>
              <strong>Scope Difference:</strong>
              <li>
                LocalStorage and sessionStorage are scoped to the current
                domain.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cookies can be set to a specific domain or to the entire domain
                tree.

              <strong>Capacity Difference:</strong>
              <li>
                LocalStorage and sessionStorage have a larger storage capacity
                (up to 10 MB or more) <br />compared to cookies (up to 4 KB).

                Cookies have an expiration date, while localStorage and
                sessionStorage do not.
              </li>
              <li>
                This means that cookies can persist even after the user closes
                the browser, while LocalStorage and sessionStorage are cleared
                when the user closes the tab or window.

              <strong>Accessibility Difference:</strong>
              <li>
                Cookies can be accessed by both the client-side (JavaScript) and
                server-side (PHP, Node.js, etc.) code.

            Q.3: What is Event Loop & how does it work?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>
              <strong>Definition of Event Loop:</strong>
              An event loop is a programming construct that manages the flow of
              events in a program. It operates by continuously checking for and
              processing events in a program's event queue, which are typically
              generated by external sources such as user input, network
              requests, or timers. The event loop retrieves events from the
              queue and executes the appropriate event handler functions to
              perform any necessary actions. This allows programs to handle
              complex event-driven scenarios in a structured and efficient
              manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >Here's a more detailed breakdown of how an event loop
                works:</strong
              >
              <li>
                The program creates an event queue, which is essentially a list
                of events that need to be processed.
              </li>
              <li>
                The program registers event listeners that are responsible for
                handling specific types of events. For example, a button click
                might be handled by a "click" event listener.
              </li>
              <li>When an event occurs, it is added to the event queue.</li>
              <li>
                The event loop continuously checks the event queue for new
                events.
              </li>
              <li>
                If an event is found in the queue, the event loop retrieves the
                event and sends it to the appropriate event listener.
              </li>
              <li>
                The event listener processes the event and performs any
                necessary actions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once the event has been processed, the event listener returns
                control to the event loop, which continues to check the event
                queue for new events.
              </li>

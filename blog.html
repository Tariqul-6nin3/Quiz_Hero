            Q.1: What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content ml-4">
            <p>
              <strong>Definiton Of DOM:</strong> DOM stands for Document Object
              Model. It is an interface for programming through which structure,
              style and content can be access and manipulate of a web document.
              DOM can interact the web document over HTML and CSS. It represents
              the whole web document as nodes and object. Generally on condition
              change we can change the structure, style and content of HTML
              elements or web pages. DOM is not a programming language, but
              without it, javascript wouldn't have control on webpages, HTML
              document, svg document and etc. They all can be accessed and
              manipulated by DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Purposes of DOM: </strong> The main purpose of the
              Document Object Model (DOM) is to provide a way for web developers
              to programmatically manipulate the content and structure of web
              pages. Some common use cases of the DOM include:

              <li>
                Accessing and modifying HTML elements: The DOM allows developers
                to access HTML elements on a web page and modify their
                properties, such as their content, style, or attributes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Adding or removing HTML elements: Developers can use the DOM to
                dynamically add or remove HTML elements from a web page,
                allowing them to create dynamic and interactive content.
              </li>
            </p>

            Q.2: How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM
            methods?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>
              The most common way to access a HTML element is to use 'id' of an
              element. Generally HTML elements and all other attributes makes a
              document within this document we can access and manipulate the
              HTML structure, style and content by DOM.<br />
              There are five ways of selecting element using DOM are followings:
              <li>
                getElementById(): This method returns the element with the
                specified ID attribute.
              </li>
              <li>
                getElementsByClassName(): This method returns a collection of
                elements that have a specific class name.
              </li>
              <li>
                getElementsByTagName(): This method returns a collection of
                elements that have a specific tag name.
              </li>
              <li>
                querySelector(): This method returns the first element that
                matches a specified CSS selector
              </li>
              <li>
                querySelectorAll(): This method returns a collection of all
                elements that match a specified CSS selector.
              </li>
            </p>

            Q.3: What is event bubble?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>
              <strong>Definition of Event Bubble:</strong>
              What is event bubble? Event bubbling is such a concepts that, when
              an event receives a command to the innermost target element and
              that events bubble up (or we can say is transmitted or propagated)
              to its parants untill the root element come through a DOM tree.
              The major use of event bubbling is the registration of default
              functions present in the program.Event bubbling is important in
              web development because it allows developers to create more
              modular and reusable code by attaching event listeners to parent
              elements rather than individual child elements. However, it can
              also lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues if not
              managed properly.

            Q.4: What is a callback function and why will you use it?

          <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>
              <strong>Definition Of Callback function:</strong>
              When we need a pre-determined function executions after an another
              function's executions, then we can use a callback function. A
              callback function is a type of function in programming that is
              defined separately from the function in which it is used. The main
              function can then call the callback function at specific points
              during its execution, passing it as an argument to achieve a
              particular task. The callback function is usually used to execute
              some code after the main function has completed a specific task,
              or when a certain event occurs.
